# SQL-notebook
> *The notes in this notebook, as well a exercises were done using https://sqliteonline.com/, a web-based and free SQL compiler/RDBMS. SQLite does not require installation! You can access the compiler by visiting the official website at [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and importing the databases you want to work on.

I would also like to credit the repository [SQL-101](https://github.com/biancainocencio/SQL-101/tree/main), from where I drew inspiration on the markdown code and notebook organization, as well as overall tips.

# SQL Basics
If you are looking for the very basics on how to work with SQL, e.g. what a `SELECT` is, I suggest you visit the [SQL-101](https://github.com/biancainocencio/SQL-101/tree/main) repo, or check the other files in this repository. I've uploaded my personal notes on the simplest SQL commands.
